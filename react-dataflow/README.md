# Observable Example: React + Dataflow

See it live: https://observablehq.github.io/examples/react-dataflow/

This modifies the React code generated by the Embed tool to facilitate dataflow between the notebook and the React app. The `height` state of `<App>` (React) is passed down to `<BrushableScatterplot>` (Observable), where it is passed into the Runtime’s `module.redefine` method. And a `setSelection` function is passed into the scatterplot component, which it calls in a custom [Observer](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime#observers) when the `selection` variable is fulfilled.

This Rollup configuration supports file attachments, whereas many React environments (like the one you get from `create-react-app`) stumble on file attachments’ use of import.meta.
