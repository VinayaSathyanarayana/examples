# Observable Example: React + FileAttachment

See it live: https://observablehq.github.io/examples/react-file-attachment/

This Rollup configuration supports file attachments, whereas many React environments (like the one you get from `create-react-app`) stumble on file attachmentsâ€™ use of import.meta.

See also [this example using create-react-app](../react-create-react-app), which tweaks the way file attachments are loaded.
