This repository contains several small self-contained examples of embedding Observable notebooks in other contexts.

| Example | Description | 
|---|---|
| [**simple-constant**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/simple-constant) | Just about the most straightforward embed possible |
| [**simple-generator**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/simple-generator) | Nearly the most straightforward embed possible, but with a generator instead of a constant |
| [**custom-data**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/custom-data) | Pass your own local data into a chart |
| [**custom-fixed-width**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/custom-fixed-width) | Overriding the Standard Library with a constant width |
| [**custom-fluid-width**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/custom-fluid-width) | Overriding the Standard Library with a generator the yields an element’s width |
| [**custom-fluid-width-and-height**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/custom-fluid-width-and-height) | Overriding the Standard Library and notebook with an element’s width and height |
| [**versioning**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/versioning) | Embedding multiple specific versions of a notebook |
| [**iframe-resize**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/iframe-resize) | Implementing Embedly’s protocol for Iframes that resize to match their contents |
| [**react-file-attachment**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/react-file-attachment) | A simple React component embedding a notebook with a file attachment |
| [**react-dataflow**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/react-dataflow) | Passing data between a React app and an Observable notebook |
| [**breakout**](https://observablehq.github.io/examples/breakout) | An extravagant way to demonstrate mutable state |
