This repository contains several small self-contained examples of embedding Observable notebooks in other contexts.

| Example | Description |
|---|---|
| [**simple-constant**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/simple-constant/) | Just about the most straightforward embed possible |
| [**simple-generator**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/simple-generator/) | Nearly the most straightforward embed possible, but with a generator instead of a constant |
| [**custom-data**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/custom-data/) | Pass your own local data into a chart |
| [**custom-fixed-width**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/custom-fixed-width/) | Overriding the Standard Library with a constant width |
| [**custom-fluid-width**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/custom-fluid-width/) | Overriding the Standard Library with a generator the yields an element’s width |
| [**custom-fluid-width-and-height**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/custom-fluid-width-and-height/) | Overriding the Standard Library and notebook with an element’s width and height |
| [**standalone**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/standalone/) | Self-hosting an Observable notebook with no external dependencies |
| [**versioning**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/versioning/) | Embedding multiple specific versions of a notebook |
| [**iframe-resize**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/iframe-resize/) | Implementing Embedly’s protocol for Iframes that resize to match their contents |
| [**react-create-react-app**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/react-create-react-app/) | Embedding an Observable notebook in a create-react-app application |
| [**react-file-attachment**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/react-file-attachment/) | A simple React component embedding a notebook with a file attachment |
| [**react-dataflow**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/react-dataflow/) | Passing data between a React app and an Observable notebook |
| [**breakout**](https://github.com/observablehq/examples/tree/main/breakout/) | An extravagant way to demonstrate mutable state |
