This repository contains several small self-contained examples of embedding Observable notebooks in other contexts.

| Example | Description |
|---|---|
| [**simple-constant**](./simple-constant/) | Just about the most straightforward embed possible |
| [**simple-generator**](./simple-generator/) | Nearly the most straightforward embed possible, but with a generator instead of a constant |
| [**custom-data**](./custom-data/) | Pass your own local data into a chart |
| [**custom-fixed-width**](./custom-fixed-width/) | Overriding the Standard Library with a constant width |
| [**custom-fluid-width**](./custom-fluid-width/) | Overriding the Standard Library with a generator the yields an element’s width |
| [**custom-fluid-width-and-height**](./custom-fluid-width-and-height/) | Overriding the Standard Library and notebook with an element’s width and height |
| [**versioning**](./versioning/) | Embedding multiple specific versions of a notebook |
| [**iframe-resize**](./iframe-resize/) | Implementing Embedly’s protocol for Iframes that resize to match their contents |
| [**react-file-attachment**](./react-file-attachment/) | A simple React component embedding a notebook with a file attachment |
| [**react-dataflow**](./react-dataflow/) | Passing data between a React app and an Observable notebook |
| [**breakout**](./breakout/) | An extravagant way to demonstrate mutable state |
